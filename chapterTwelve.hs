Write the function myIterate using direct recursion.
Compare the behavior with the built-in iterate to gauge correctness.
Do not look at the source or any examples of iterate so that you are forced to do this yourself.

-- iterate is like a very limited
-- unfold that never ends
Prelude> :t iterate
iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
-- because it never ends, we must use
-- take to get a finite list
Prelude> take 10 $ iterate (+1) 0
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

-- unfoldr is the full monty
Prelude> :t unfoldr
unfoldr :: (b -> Maybe (a, b)) -> b -> [a]
-- Using unfoldr to do the same as thing as iterate
Prelude> take 10 $ unfoldr (\b -> Just (b, b+1)) 0

  Rewrite myIterate into betterIterate using myUnfoldr.
  A hint â€“ we used unfoldr to produce the same results as iterate earlier.
  Do this with different functions and see if you can abstract the structure out.
  It helps to have the types in front of you
